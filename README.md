A CLI tool that handles os notification tasks in the background.
## Getting Started:
1. Run `npm install` in *notify* subdirectory
2. Run `make all` to build Go binaries
3. Run `node notify/notify.js` to start server
4. In another command line, run `./bin/server`
5. In a third command line, run `./bin/client` to start the CLI tool
## Notes:
- notification images can be stored in *notify/assets* and used by node-notifier
